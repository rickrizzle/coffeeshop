          <h3>Our Values</h3>
            Ricky's Java Beans has been serving the community in Rickville for over 27 years. </br>In that time we've made it our mission to deliver the best customer 
            experience </br> and serve the <strong>best</strong> coffee you've ever tasted.
        </div>

      <div class="middle">Our Methods
      
          <p>We use every coffee brewing trick in the book to serve the best coffee for the community. You name it, we got it.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>V60 Vortex Pour-Over</li>
              <p>In other words, a pour-over. Makes one fresh cup at a time. We use this instead of a big coffee brewer machine.</p>
            <li>Our famous Cold Brews</li>
              <p>Our most well-known and most-served coffee. Cold brews are low in acidity and high in caffeine. This is a drink that can be served so many ways, we love it!</p>
            <li>Japanese Style Ice Coffees</li>
              <p>An old but new style for us. Japanese style iced coffee (<em>Aisu Kohi</em>) is also known as "Flash brewed." The hot coffee is directly poured over ice
              to lock in the flavors. For this reason it's superior to cold brew for lighter roasts with more complex notes. Quickly becoming a favorite!</p>
            <li>Aeropress</li>
                <p>The Aeropress is a great little device. It's a simple to use plunger method that creates a vacuum press to extract the coffee oils. It's
                  much more simple than it sounds and makes an excellent cup of coffee or individual shots of expresso.
                </p>
            <li>French Press</li>
                <p>An old stand-by perfect for groups or for an individual who likes more to drink. French press is a great way to enjoy cup after cup of your favorite
                  coffee.
                </p>
            <li>Old-fashioned Espresso Shots</li>
                <P>When you got to go, you have to go! Espresso puts the pep in everyone's step. We typically make our espresso roasts with lighter and medium roasts 
                  to appreciate the notes better. Espresso is such a versatile way to drink coffee it's no wonder it's one of the most popular options. Enjoy it in a latte, in 
                  your regular coffee, or by itself. You can even try it on top one our many desserts!
                </P>

      <div class="bottom">Our Coffees
            <p>Ricky's has travelled around the world and brought back the best coffees from every region of the planet. Well, except Antartica. Sorry Penguins.
              Check out our selection below.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Colombian</li>
                <p>The gold standard from one of the biggest coffee exporters in the world. Colombian coffees are citrusy and higher in acidity. 
                  They make great medium roasts, and are best served hot.</p>
              <li>Ethiopia, Kenya, and Zimbabwe</li>
                  <p>This is where it all began. Thousands of years ago, coffee was first brewed in Ethiopia. From there the magic bean spread across the globe.
                    African coffees are known for their fruity and nutty notes. They have higher acidity like Latin coffees, but not too high to enjoy iced. 
                    African coffees are great as pour-overs or as a Japanese iced coffee.
                  </p>
              <li>Southeast Asia</li>
                  <p>The smaller farms in the highlands of Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam make some of the best coffees in the world.
                    If you like medium to dark roasts, you have to try these roasts. Best served as a cold-brew or in the Aeropress.
                  </p>
              <li>Indonesia</li>
                  <p>Darker than dark, if you like your coffee with strong notes of chocolate and bitter, this is for you. The world "Java" comes from the Indonesian 
                    island of Java, a big exporter of coffee beans. Best served in the French press or pour-over.
                  </p>
